The first long flash after that means no timer. All flashes after that mean one second each. Max is 254.

3. Strobe frequency

 To set strobe frequency you make 12 short presses and after that you will get a few seconds short flashes.
All long flashes after that mean 5 ms delay each. Max is 255 (1275ms).
So i.e 10 flashes mean 50 ms delay which is 10 hz.
Tactical strobe should be 10-20 hz which mean 5-10 flashes.
