For use in 105d type drivers, no support for stars.

To choose group you make eight short presses and after that you will get eight short flashes.
Now you count all long flashes and switch off when you reach your group.

1. 100
2. 50, 100
3. 10, 50, 100
4. 10, 50, 100, Strobe
5. 100, 50
6. 100, 50, 10
7. 2 with memory
8. 3 with memory
9. 4 with memory
10. 5 with memory
11. 6 with memory

To set full mode timer just let it pass all the groups and you will get eight short flashes again.
The first long flash after that means no timer. All other flashes means one second each. Max is 254.
