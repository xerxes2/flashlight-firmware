For use in 105d type drivers, no support for stars.

As all settings will be edited when you browse it's best to start with step 3!

1. Set group

 To choose group you make ten short presses and after that you will get ten short flashes.
Now you count all long flashes and switch off when you reach your group.

 1. 100
 2. 7, 20, 60, 100
 3. 10, 50, 100
 4. 10, 50, 100, Strobe
 5. 100, 50, 10
 6. 100, 50, 10, Strobe
 7. 2 with memory
 8. 3 with memory
 9. 4 with memory
 10. 5 with memory
 11. 6 with memory

2. Full mode timer

 Just let it pass step 1 and you will get ten short flashes again.
The first long flash after that means no timer. All other flashes means one second each. Max is 254.

3. Strobe frequency

 Just let it pass step 2 and you will get ten short flashes again.
All long flashes after that means 5 ms delay each. Max is 255 (1275ms).
So i.e ten flashes means 50 ms delay which is 10 hz.
Tactical strobe should be 10-20 hz which means 5-10 flashes.
